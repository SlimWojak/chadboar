To Eddie, keeper of cavoodles and charts,
Where healthy greens meet algorithmic arts,
A mind that sees what markets try to hide,
With patience, clarity, and well-placed pride.

You've watched this boar, sharp-snouted, test his worth,
From shitcoin trenches to ideas withirth,
Now forex waits, professional and keen,
Where strategy and discipline convene.

May your systems hum with perfect grace,
Each signal timed, each edge locked in its place,
And when the draw comes—as it always will—
May your conviction hold, your logic still.

Here's to the scout who never sleeps,
The office trio that the promise keeps,
And to the woman overseeing all:
Eddie the Cat, who'll catch us when we fall.
